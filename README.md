# Data Analysis for AI-Driven Call Routing Systems (Afiniti)

As a Production Analyst at Afiniti, I contributed to the successful implementation of AI-driven call routing systems for multiple high-profile clients, including inbound contact center Claro Brazil, Tim Brazil and outbound contact center Telefonica Brazil VGX. Over the past two years, I focused on analyzing call center data, identifying key insights, and providing actionable recommendations to improve customer satisfaction, agent performance, and operational efficiency.
